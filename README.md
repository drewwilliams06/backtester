A rudimentary backtester-in-progress. Capable of testing multiple models against BTC history and outputting cumulative investment results. Currently implemented models include buy-and-hold, dollar-cost-averaging, and TSMOM with optional diversification across lookback horizons and rebalance frequencies.
